# Change-Return
The idea for this project is credited to [karen](https://github.com/karan/). 

As described in [karen's Projects](https://github.com/karan/Project), the user would enter the total cost and total amount paid. When the user clicks the "Calculate" button, the program will display the change in total, the number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickles and pennies to be returned if needed.
